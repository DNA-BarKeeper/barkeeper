    ### Thanks

    Sinatra would not have been possible without strong company backing.
    In the past, financial and emotional support have been provided mainly by
    [Heroku](http://heroku.com), [GitHub](https://github.com) and
    [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com/), and is now taken care of by
    [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.com/).

    Special thanks to the following extraordinary individuals, without whom
    Sinatra would not be possible:

    * [Ryan Tomayko](http://tomayko.com/) (rtomayko) for constantly fixing
      whitespace errors __60d5006__
    * [Ezra Zygmuntowicz](http://brainspl.at/) (ezmobius) for initial help and
      letting Blake steal some of merbs internal code.
    * [Chris Schneider](http://gittr.com) (cschneid) for The Book, the blog,
      [irclogger.com](http://irclogger.com/sinatra/), and a bunch of useful
      patches.
    * [Markus Prinz](http://nuclearsquid.com/) (cypher) for patches over the
      years, caring about the README, and hanging in there when times were rough.

    * [Karel Minarik](https://github.com/karmi) (karmi) for screaming until the
      website came back up.
    * [Jeremy Evans](http://code.jeremyevans.net/) (jeremyevans) for unbreaking
      optional path params (twice!)

    * Mathew Walker for making escaped paths work with static files.
