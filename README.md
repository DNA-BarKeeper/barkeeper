# BarKeeper

A versatile web framework to assemble, analyze and manage DNA barcode data and metadata.

- Example usage: https://gbol5.de

## Using BarKeeper for your own project
You can set up your own project with BarKeeper Web Framework easily by running it via Docker. 
If you don't know what Docker is, read their excellent [Get Started with Docker guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

### Prerequisites
Here's what you need to prepare before you can start the setup process:
- Make sure that you have a stable internet connection during all steps of the setup process.
- Have a server set up running Ubuntu 16.04 or higher versions. You will also need a user with sudo rights during the installation process. 
It is highly recommended that you establish suitable server security measures like a properly configured firewall.
- Install Docker (choose the appropriate tutorial for Ubuntu Linux [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)). The installed Docker version needs to be 18.06 or higher.
- Install Docker Compose. You can find detailed instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/). 
The installed Docker-Compose version needs to be 1.27 or higher.
- Clone the code from this repository to a suitable location on your server.
- Make sure the ports used by redis and postgres are not already in use on your machine (redis: 6379, Postgres: 5432).
- If you want to run mislabel analyses on the sequences stored in your database on a remote server (SSH address can be specified in .env file)
make sure that the SATIVA files are available and the alignment tool MAFFT is installed there. More information about SATIVA can be found [here](https://github.com/amkozlov/sativa).
  

### Setup
- Find the file *.env-example* and copy it to a new file *.env* in the main directory of the repository you just cloned.
- Modify the *.env* file to your project's needs. Values that you need to change are described as such in the file. 
The same goes for variables that generally should not (or don't need to) be changed.
You do not need to add values for `SECRET_KEY_BASE` and `DEVISE_KEY` yet!
If you want the app to run on a port different to the standard port 80, please specify your desired port number in the 
environment variable `PORT`. The value of the variable `PUMA_PORT` should generally not be changed.
    - After setting up **all other** environment variables and saving the file, generate secret keys for Rails and Devise
     by running `make secret` two times and copying the generated random keys from your command line. 
     Add the first key as the value for `SECRET_KEY_BASE` 
     and the second as the value of `DEVISE_KEY` in your *.env* file and save it.
       - The first time you run the `make secret` command, this will install all dependencies inside the app docker 
       container. This can take some time! The following invocation should run much quicker then.
- Now you can install the whole app by running `make install`.
- You should be able to see the about page of your project's new app on your domain now.
    - HTTPS is not enabled yet. If you want to configure this, you will have to change the *nginx.conf* file manually 
    and install a certificate. You can find more information [here](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html).
- Use the admin credentials you added to the *.env* file to initially log in and create new records for your project.
    - You can start by going to the **Admin area > Home configuration** page and change the About page background and 
    add a description of your project.
- You are done! Now you and your team can use the new app and start uploading data!

- To stop and restart the app use the commands `make stop` followed by `make start` or just `make restart`.
- To remove BarKeeper containers created on your system use `make remove`.
