# Barcode Workflow Manager

A web framework to assemble, analyze and manage DNA barcode data and metadata.

- Example usage: https://gbol5.de

### Setup
- Install Docker
- Install Docker Compose
- Clone BWM repository from GitHub
- Find file .env-example, copy it to .env in the main bwm directory and modify to your needs
    - Make sure the ports used by redis and postgres are not already in use (redis: 6379, pg: 5432)
    - After setting up all other env vars generate secret keys for SECRET_KEY_BASE und DEVISE_KEY by running make secret (two times)
       - The first time you run the command, this will install all dependencies inside the app container. This can take some time. 
       - Stop the container afterwards by running make stop
- Run make install (an internet connection is needed)
- You should be able to see the about page of your new app on your domain now
- Use the admin credentials you added to the env file to initially log in and create records
