      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p><em>BarKeeper</em> combines multiple tools to aid barcoding initiatives and similar projects in every step from a target taxa list to finished barcode sequences, thereby minimizing data loss and making workflows more efficient. It offers a great deal of flexibility by not focusing on specific markers or taxon groups.</p>
      <p><em>BarKeeper</em> is free, open-source, and available as a Docker image for easy setup on a server. Once installed, it provides its services for all project members with an internet-capable device, independent of their operating system or location.</p>
      <p>The source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/DNA-BarKeeper/barkeeper">GitHub</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="general-structure-and-usage">General structure and usage</h2>
      <p><em>BarKeeper</em> allows users to store data and metadata related to barcoding or phylogenetics in data tables. These records can then be edited, searched or used for further analyses. </p>
      <p>
        <img alt="Dataflow" class="lightbox-image doc-image" src=<%= asset_path('Manual/BarKeeper_Dataflow.png') %> />
      </p>
      <p>This diagram shows the simplified dataflow of <em>BarKeeper</em>. Color coding in the figure distinguishes data types (blue boxes) from processes (yellow boxes) of the app. Arrows indicate the direction of interactions.</p>
      <p>Users can upload information about markers, primers, DNA isolates, taxa and specimens manually or via spreadsheets. Taxonomic information can also be automatically retrieved from certain databases. The app will automatically attempt to assemble uploaded Sanger sequencing reads to create contigs. These can then be manually edited and verified. Barcode sequences are generated from verified contigs and are regularly checked for potential taxonomic mislabels automatically. Finished sequences can be viewed or downloaded. Raw HTS data will be processed by the app by first splitting it by plate and performing extensive quality filtering, then assigning sample IDs based on barcodes (tags) and primers and finally clustering the sequences and performing a BLAST search to confirm the assigned taxonomic label.</p>
      <p>This manual will describe the different workflows and features of the app in more detail.</p>
      <h3 id="the-main-menu">The main menu</h3>
      <p>To help navigate the different types of data and features the main menu is structured into different sections: </p>
      <p>The first main menu item with the name of the currently active project contains links to general information like the about page, a diagram depicting the main project&#39;s progress and a link to a list of sub-projects, as well as to advanced search features and analysis features included in the app as a drop down menu. More information about projects, advanced search and analyses can be found in this manual.</p>
      <p>The second and third menu items hold links to record collections belonging either to the category <strong>Taxa</strong> (taxonomic information) or <strong>DNA</strong> (molecular information).</p>
      <p>The <strong>Admin</strong> menu item is only available for project administrators and supervisors and contains links to homepage and user management pages.</p>
      <p>By clicking on the user icon in the top right corner while logged in, a page with information and options regarding the current user can be opened.</p>
      <h3 id="data-tables">Data tables</h3>
      <p>If you navigate to a record index page, e.g. the one containing specimen records, you will see the according data in a table structure. Tables like this exist for many types of records within the app.</p>
      <p>
        <img class="lightbox-image doc-image" alt="Specimens Index" src=<%= asset_path('Manual/specimens_datatable.png') %> />
      </p>
      <p>In this main table you can find some data and metadata for each record and can <strong>sort and filter</strong> the table view to your needs. By using the delete link you can also <strong>delete single records</strong> if necessary. By clicking on a name or ID you get to the <strong>view page</strong> of this single record, for example a single specimen, where you can view and edit all information concerning this specific record:</p>
      <p>
        <img class="lightbox-image doc-image" alt="Specimen View" src=<%= asset_path('Manual/specimen_detail_view.png') %> />
      </p>
      <p>Below the main table you find a button to <strong>create a new record</strong> of this type. The form that opens will look similar to the edit page but with blank fields. Some information like the name of a record usually has to be entered to allow creation while other fields are optional. After saving a record, you will then be able to see it in the main table.</p>
      <p>In case of some records (species, isolates, primers) you can <strong>add multiple new records</strong> at a time by uploading a table file (templates can be downloaded) containing data about these records.</p>
      <p>
        <img class="lightbox-image doc-image" alt="Primer Reads Index" src=<%= asset_path('Manual/primer_reads_datatable.png') %> />
      </p>
      <p>To <strong>add new primer reads</strong>, you can upload one or multiple AB1 and SCF files which will then automatically be processed by the app. You can find out more about your options to edit and assemble primer reads in this manual.</p>
      <p>Below the specimen data table you will find a button to download the database contents in CSV format. This will contain all information and meta information about all specimens in your currently selected project.</p>
      <h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
      <p>Records in the app can be assigned to projects. This allows you to group specific records for analyses and display only those that you currently want to work with. Only administrators are able to create new projects. </p>
      <p>Each user can change the currently displayed project in their profile view. This will affect what is displayed in all data tables across the app.The name of the currently active project is shown in the main menu bar at the top of the page or &#39;Project&#39; in case no specific project is selected.</p>
      <p>On each view page of single records the projects this record belongs to are displayed and can be edited.</p>
      <p>Projects can be bulk assigned to a taxon and all its child taxa via the &#39;Associate Taxa' tab on the projects index page.</p>
      <h3 id="progress-status">Progress status</h3>
      <p>You can find the progress diagram page as a sub menu item (<em>Current project name</em> <em>â†’</em> <em>Progress status</em>) of the main menu.</p>
      <p>Here you can see the progress of your your currently selected project as interactive diagrams:</p>
      <p>
        <img class="lightbox-image doc-image" alt="Progress status" src=<%= asset_path('Manual/progress_diagram.png') %> />
      </p>
      <p>On the top left you are able to select any marker in your current project to display a progress diagram for it. You can use your mouse to drag the diagram around and zoom in and out with your mouse wheel. Use the button in the section tree navigation to re-center the tree again and return it to its original zoom status.</p>
      <p>The leaves of the tree represent families in your project&#39;s taxonomy whereas the size of the nodes represents the number of species in these families. The node color represents the amount of species within that have at least one finished marker sequence for the selected marker. The color scale in the top left helps you estimate the value. If you hover over a name or a node, a tooltip with  exact values will appear.</p>
      <p>It is possible to download a CSV table with the exact number of marker sequences associated to each species for the selected marker.</p>
      <h2 id="user-area">User area</h2>
      <p>
        <img class="lightbox-image doc-image" alt="User Area" src=<%= asset_path('Manual/user_profile.png') %> />
      </p>
      <p>By clicking on the user icon in the top right corner while logged in, you can review and edit your personal information. Some fields like role, responsibilities and lab association can only be changed by admins since they affect your permissions within the app. You yourself can change your user name, e-mail address and password.</p>
      <p>On this page you can also change the currently selected project out of all projects you are associated with.</p>
      <p>This will affect what records are displayed throughout the app!</p>
      <p>In the last section of this page your past advanced searches can be accessed. See the manual section about advanced searches to find out more about this feature.</p>
      <h2 id="advanced-searches">Advanced searches</h2>
      <p>On top of quickly sorting and filtering each data table, you can use the search bar in the navigation bar, which will search across all types of records.</p>
      <p>For some types of records (contigs, specimens, marker sequences) a more advanced search feature is available as well.</p>
      <p>
        <img class="lightbox-image doc-image" alt="Advanced Specimen Search" src=<%= asset_path('Manual/advanced_specimen_search.png') %> />
      </p>
      <p>Here you can specify multiple search criteria at once and thereby look for specific records or groups of records that fit this description. If you fill in the title field, the search will later be available from the page linked to in your profile as mentioned before. </p>
      <p>The search result will always reflect the current state of the database and not remain as it were when the search was created!</p>
      <p>You can use the fact that search results always reflect the current state of records to your advantage e.g. by checking if there are still records with unsolved issues or some that remain unverified while you work on these tasks.</p>
      <p>You can also download the search results in different formats. Contig search results can be downloaded either as a PDE file that only contains the sequences (primer reads and consensus) or as an archive that contains the raw reads as AB1 or SCF files as well. To download an archive it is necessary to trigger its creation on the server and wait a couple of minutes until it is ready for download. Marker sequence search results can be downloaded as FASTA or PDE files. Specimen search results can be downloaded as CSV tables.</p>
      <h2 id="taxonomy">Taxonomy</h2>
      <p>To review the hierarchical structure of taxa uploaded to <em>BarKeeper</em> you can view an interactive diagram of their taxonomy in the Taxa menu.</p>
      <p>
        <img class="lightbox-image doc-image" alt="Taxonomy" src=<%= asset_path('Manual/taxonomy.png') %> />
      </p>
      <p>If multiple root taxa are available you can choose one in the top left drop down menu of the Tree Navigation section. The first root taxon will already be displayed when the page is loaded. To search for a specific taxon in the tree, if this node is currently not visible, use the search field below. You can drag the tree around and zoom in or out using your mouse. Reset to the original position and zoom factor by clicking the left button in the Tree Navigation section.</p>
      <p>Filled grey circles in the tree indicate that this node has children. If they are currently not visible you can click the node to expand them, otherwise clicking a parent node will hide the child nodes again. Clicking on the name of a taxon will select it and display more details about it in a separate section to the left of the tree. If a taxon is selected you can also use the right button in the Tree Navigation section to center it.</p>
      <p>If a selected taxon has associated Specimen records, these will be displayed in a section on the left as well.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you are able to download a CSV table with all data and metadata concerning all taxa in your currently selected project.</p>
      <p>The downloaded CSV will not reflect the currently displayed taxonomy.</p>
      <p>To add taxa to the app, you can either add single taxa manually or upload a CSV file. In this case, please follow the template that is available for download. In this CSV you can specify a parent taxon either by its name or its ID in the app. If the specified parent cannot be found in the database, no parent will be added and the taxon will appear as an &quot;orphaned&quot; entry. If no taxonomic rank is specified, the taxon will appear in the app as &quot;unranked&quot;.</p>
      <p>You can find the ID of each record in the link shown in you browser when you visit a taxon record&#39;s page. It will look like <em>https://&lt;main_domain&gt;/taxa/<strong>&lt;ID&gt;</strong>/edit</em></p>
      <p>Each scientific name may only refer to one specific taxon record and not be used again. If a taxon name has synonyms, please rather use the according field instead of creating more taxon records.</p>
      <h2 id="primer-reads-and-contigs">Primer Reads and Contigs</h2>
      <h3 id="read-upload-and-editing">Read upload and editing</h3>
      <p>Primer reads in AB1 or SCF format can be uploaded via the file input on the primer read index page. You can upload a single file or multiple ones at the same time.</p>
      <p>After uploading a read, the app will automatically try to assign it to a contig and a primer. Multiple reads generated from the same isolate will automatically be assigned to the same contig.</p>
      <p>For this to work it is very important that all file names follow the pattern <em>&lt;isolate_identifier&gt;_&lt;primer_name&gt;.scf/ab1</em>!
        It is also important that a record for the used primer was added to the app before uploading the read file. </p>
      <p>The app will attempt to trim the reads based on some preset parameters (in a window of 10 bases, at least 8 have to have a quality score above 30). These parameters can be changed before attempting to trim the read again. Alternatively you can trim the read manually using the graphic interface or by typing the indices of readable bases in the according form fields. To use the graphic interface just click the border of the grey and white areas (start or end of read) and drag it to the desired position. On this page you can also decide whether or not a read should be used in a contig assembly.</p>
      <p>
        <img class="lightbox-image doc-image" alt="Primer Read View" src=<%= asset_path('Manual/primer_read_detail_view.png') %> />
      </p>
      <p>The app will also extract base calls from the raw files. If some base calls are not appropriate, you can change them in this view by clicking on a base and typing the appropriate symbol instead. Hit enter to save the new base call.</p>
      <p>Below the primer read view you can find some navigation controls to move over the read or jump to specific base indices.</p>
      <p>In the <em>Description</em> tab you find more information about the read and its associated records in the app (primer, marker, contig). You can change its orientation and restart the automatic primer and contig assignment process in case it did not give the desired results the first time.</p>
      <p>In the <em>Files</em> tab you can download the trimmed read as a FASTA file or the original file (AB1/SCF).</p>
      <h3 id="contig-assembly-and-verification">Contig assembly and verification</h3>
      <p>After more than one read was uploaded and assigned to the same contig, the app will automatically try to assemble them to a contig. It uses a slightly modified Needleman-Wunsch-algorithm to achieve this. The default parameters for assembly can be modified in the Description tab of each contig. Here it can be specified how long overlapping regions need to be and how many mismatches will be allowed in the overlapping region (in %). If an assembly fails, it can help to relax these parameters a little or check the quality of the primer reads again.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is possible to exclude specific reads from assembly either directly in the contig view from the context menu that opens by clicking on the &quot;i&quot; symbol next to the read name (as shown below) or in the primer read view.</p>
      <p>
        <img class="lightbox-image doc-image" alt="Contig View" src=<%= asset_path('Manual/contig_detail_view.png') %> />
      </p>
      <p>To visualize the assembly and get a better impression of overlapping areas the user can move the primer reads up and down. The bottom line will always show the consensus sequence as calculated by the app. If necessary, single reads can be displayed as a more detailed view above the contig view by clicking on their name. This detailed view can be toggled on and off for each individual read. By clicking on a specific base within a read, the app will directly jump to that position when it opens the detailed read view. If you would rather open the view page of a read in a new browser tab where more information is available, you can open it from the context menu.</p>
      <p>Below the contig view all reads that could or should not be assembled (because they have low quality, weren&#39;t appropriately trimmed yet or have been excluded by the user) are listed.</p>
      <p>If you are satisfied with the assembly and would like to accept the consensus sequence as a marker sequence and use it in further analyses, you can click on the verify button below. A new record for a marker sequence will then be created by the app. If you change your mind at a later point, it is also possible to reverse the verification. All verified contigs will show who verified it and when. It is also possible to search for contigs verified by a specific person in the advanced contig search.</p>
      <h2 id="sativa-mislabel-analysis">SATIVA mislabel analysis</h2>
      <p>All newly created marker sequences will periodically be checked for possible issues in a taxonomy-based mislabel check. This is performed with the SATIVA algorithm (1) that builds a tree based on all sequences and performs a systematic leave-one-out analysis to check if the placement of a sequence in the tree conforms to its taxonomic label. If any incongruences occur, these sequences will be tagged accordingly in the app and highlighted with a red exclamation mark. </p>
      <p>
        <img class="lightbox-image doc-image" alt="SATIVA warning" src=<%= asset_path('Manual/sativa_warning.png') %> />
      </p>
      <p>Such incongruences could be the result of contamination of DNA samples or other problems in the lab workflow. If multiple sequences per isolate show issues, the associated isolate and specimen will also be tagged, allowing to check for potential misidentifications that may be underlying the problematic taxonomic label. Users can then review the problematic sequences and associated records and either make changes to the data or mark the issue as solved without making changes if the issue turned out to be a false positive by the SATIVA algorithm.</p>
