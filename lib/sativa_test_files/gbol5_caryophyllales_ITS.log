SATIVA v0.9-57-g8a99328, released on 2017-07-15. Last version: https://github.com/amkozlov/sativa 
By A.Kozlov and J.Zhang, the Exelixis Lab. Based on RAxML 8.2.3 by A.Stamatakis.

SATIVA was called as follows:

/home/sarah/SATIVA/sativa/sativa.py -s gbol5_caryophyllales_ITS_aligned.fasta -t gbol5_caryophyllales_ITS.tax -x BOT

*** STEP 1: Building the reference tree using provided alignment and taxonomic annotations ***

=> Loading taxonomy from file: gbol5_caryophyllales_ITS.tax ...

==> Loading reference alignment from file: gbol5_caryophyllales_ITS_aligned.fasta ...

===> Validating taxonomy and alignment ...

====> Building a multifurcating tree from taxonomy with 280 seqs ...

=====> Building the reference alignment ...

======> Saving the outgroup for later re-rooting ...

=======> Resolving multifurcation: choosing the best topology from 1 independent RAxML runs ...

========> Calling RAxML-EPA to obtain branch labels ...

=========> Post-processing the EPA tree (re-rooting, taxonomic labeling etc.) ...

==========> Saving the reference JSON file: ./gbol5_caryophyllales_ITS.refjson

*** STEP 2: Searching for mislabels ***

Running the leave-one-sequence-out test...

Leave-one-out test identified 40 suspicious sequences; running final EPA test to check them...

Mislabeled sequences by rank:
Family      :	5
Genus       :	29

Total mislabels: 34 / 12.14 %

Analysis completed successfully, elapsed time: 1006 seconds (449s reftree, 557s leave-one-out)
